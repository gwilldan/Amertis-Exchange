Amertis whispers, a tide yet to rise, Pooling the streams where liquidity lies. Bound by code, yet free to create, A future shaped by those who wait. Early believers, your trust won&apos;t fade, You lit the spark, the groundwork laid. Through trials and tests, the strong remain, MertNFTâ€”your mark on the chain. ðŸš€âœ¨</p>
